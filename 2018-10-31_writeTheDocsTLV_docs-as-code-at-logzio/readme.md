# Tools we use at Logz.io

The last slide shows the tools I chose for Logz.io docs.
I'm also putting them here for easier reference.

## The docs

**Web address:** [docs.logz.io](https://docs.logz.io)
**Repo:** [github.com/logzio/logz-docs](https://github.com/logzio/logz-docs)

## Tools

* Hosting, continuous delivery: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

* Static site generator: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with a custom template

* Access management: [GitHub](https://github.com/)

* API: [ReDoc](https://github.com/rebilly/redoc)

* Search: [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/)


* Text editing: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (I _highly_ recommend it).
    * You can see my [configuration](https://gist.github.com/imnotashrimp/840d3ee75c42ab3b6f95031b377bcc0b), so maybe you'll find some useful extensions, linters, etc.
    * Whatever static site generator you use, see if it has an extension for Visual Studio Code. It's an unbelievable time saver.
